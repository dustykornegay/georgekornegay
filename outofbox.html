Micro-Weeks:
</bold>
</br>
One of the problems our economy has is that little gets done on the
Weekends. </br>
This is impact our GDP and making America Less productive.
</br>
Let's take the USPS for example. A fine institution, that takes Sunday
off. </br>
Congress and many military decision makers aren't around when we are
off. </br>
We end up missing work all so we can have a coordinated weekend with
family. </br>
One option for the Post Office atleast is the micro-week. </br>
By working two days on and one day off, they can deliver mail 4.5 days
per week on average. </br>
We will still get mail with no more than a one day delay. </br>

Another alternative is 3 on two off. These naturally staggered work
weeks </br>

Will help ensure smoother workflow and fewer delays. </br>

Workers will have days off unencumbered, for doctors appointments and
mini-vacations. </br>

This has the potential to even out traffic flow, as some companies
pursue 10 or 11 hour shifts to meet demands. </br>

When accepted by government and military, service and readiness can be
enhanced. </br>
Especially if individuals select different off days. </br>
More experienced and highly skilled workers could be retained on three
days on five days off schedules. </br>
Keeping them active on ready reserve and adding value by passing down
experience. </br>
